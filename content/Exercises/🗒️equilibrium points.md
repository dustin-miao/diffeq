title: 🗒️Equilibrium Points
---

For each of the following [[📘order|📘1st-order]] differential equations, find all [[📘equilibrium points]] and classify each one as an [[📘attractors|📘attractor]] or a [[📘repellers|📘repeller]]:
1. $\dot{x}=ax+3$ for $a\neq 0$
2. $\dot{x}=x^4-x^2$
3. $\dot{x}=\sin^2x$

> 1. The critical point occurs at $ax+3=0$, or at $x=-3/a$. If $a>0$, then the slope is negative and the point is an [[📘attractors|📘attractor]]; otherwise, it is a [[📘repellers|📘repeller]].
> 2. The critical points are the roots of the RHS, which is $x=\pm 1, 0$. The equilibrium point $x=-1$ is a [[📘repellers|📘repeller]]:, $x=1$ is a [[📘attractors|📘attractor]], and $x=0$ is neither (since the it's a double root). 
> 3. Since $\sin^2x=\frac 1 2 (1-\cos x)$, so critical points are given by $x=k\pi$ for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$. The points are neither [[📘attractors]] or [[📘repellers]].
