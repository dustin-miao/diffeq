Use [[📙stability]] analysis to determine the quality of [[📘equilibrium points]] for the following differential equations:
1. $\dot{x}=\tan x$
2. $\dot{x}=1-e^{-x^2}$

> 1. We get that $f'(x)=\sec^2 x$. Since $f'(x^*)=\sec^2 (k\pi)=1$, all critical points are [[📘repellers]].
> 2. Since $f'(x^*)=0$, we have to resort to looking at the [[📙phase portrait]]. This tells us that the [[📘equilibrium point]] at $x=0$ is semi-stable.
