title: 🗒️Saddlenode Bifurcation
---

Suppose we have the following differential equation
$$
\dot{x}=r-x-e^{-x}.
$$
Show that this undergoes a [[📙bifuracations|saddlenode bifurcation]] and find $r$ at the collision point. Then, find the [[fl[[📕flow diagram|flow diagram]].

> Consider finding the zeroes of the [[📕phase portrait|phase portrait]]. We can do this by plotting $y=r-x$ and $y=e^{-x}$. By observation, we see that $r-x$ is tangent to $e^{-x}$ at one point at $r=1$. For $r>0$, there are two [[[[📘equilibrium points|equilibrium points]]; the one at negative $x$ is [[📘unstable|unstable]] and the one at positive $x$ is [[📘stable|stable]].
