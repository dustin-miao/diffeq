We know from physics that $V=IR$,  $V=Q/C$, and $I=dQ/dt$. Then, we get the equation $$
-V_0+IR+\frac{Q}{C}=0.
$$
Simplifying, we get that $$
\dot{Q}=\frac{V_0}{R}-\frac{Q}{RC},
$$
so $\dot{Q}$ is a linear function of $Q$ with an x-intercept at $CV_0$. Thus, the plot of $Q$ vs $t$ approaches an asymptote at $CV_0$.
