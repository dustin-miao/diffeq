Consider the differential equation $\dot{x}=\sin x$. If $x_0=\pi/4$, the resulting graph is given by

Plotting this for different values of $x_0$, we can notice how the graph tends towards values of $n\pi$ where $n$ is an odd integer. This plot is known as a _phase portrait_, or how $x(t)$ changes with respect to $t$. 

Exercise: 
Consider the differential equation $\dot{x}=x-\cos x$. The unstable equilibrium is given by $x\approx 0.739$. We know this is an unstable point because $\dot{x}$ is positive for $x>0.739$.
