This page is a set of notes for Harker's Differential Equations II course (period 5), taught by Dr. Aiyer. The course is loosely based off of Edwards' and Penney's textbook, a copy of which can be found [here](https://github.com/dustin-miao/diffeq/tree/main/resources/Edwards_Penney-Elementary_Differential_Equations.pdf).
