**Flow diagrams** are a way to visualize [[📙bifuracations]]. We can create visualize the flow along a number line using arrows, drawing points at $x$ locations that are [[📘equilibrium points]]. Plotting this for several $r$, we get a **flow diagram**. 

Note that in this convention, we only care when $\dot{x}=0$ (or the $x$-axis of the [[📕phase portrait]]). So, we equate $f(x)=0$ and plot $x$ to $r$. We denote [[📘unstable equilibrium points]] as a dashed line, and [[📘stable equilibrum points]] a solid line.

In the example of the [[📙bifuracations|📙saddlenode bifurcation]], this graph takes the form of a side-opening parabola towards negative $r$.
