title: ðŸ“—Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
---

Consider $\dot{x}=f(x)$ and $x(0)=x_0$. Suppose $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ are continuous on an open interval on the $x$-axis and $x_0$ is a real number. Then, the [[ðŸ“˜initial value problem|ðŸ“˜initial value problem]] has a unique solution $x(t)$ for some time interval $(-T, T)$ about $t=0$.
