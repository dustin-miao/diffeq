A [[ðŸ“˜order|first-order]] differential equation is said to be **homogeneous** if it can be written as 
$$
f(x,t)dt=g(x,t)dx
$$
where $f$ and $g$ are [homogeneous functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_function) of the same degree of $x$ and $y$; that is, for some parameter $\lambda$, the following equation is satisfied:
$$
\frac{f(\lambda x, \lambda t)}{g(\lambda x, \lambda t)}=\frac{f(x,t)}{g(x,t)}.
$$

To solve equations of this form, see [solving homogeneous first-order differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_differential_equation#Solution_method).
