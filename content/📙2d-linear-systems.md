A **2-D linear system** is defined by the system 
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=ax + by\\
\dot{y}&=cx + dy.\\
\end{align*}
$$
In matrix form, this is expressed as 
$$
\begin{align*}
\vec{x}&=\begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}
\dot{\vec{x}} &= A\vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \vec{x}.
\end{align*}
$$

In other words, both $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{y}$ are functions of $x$ and $y$.

In particular, this is known as a **closed orbit** because the motion eventuall returns to the starting point. As in this example, these systems arise mainly from oscillations.

> > - Finally, in the case where $a>0$, the solutions tend towards $y=0$ and $x=\pm \infty$, depending on the initial sign of $x$. If we start on the $y$-axis, the solution tends towards an [[ğŸ“˜repellers|unstable equilibrum point]] at $(0,0)$.
