Suppose we have the differential equation $\dot{x}=r+x^2$ for some parameter $r$. Let's consider the three [[📕phase portraits]] that result from $r<0$, $r=0$, and $r>0$:
1. For $r<0$, we have two critical points, where one is an [[📘attractor]] and the other is a [[📘repeller]]
2. For $r=0$, we have one semi-stable critical point at $x=0$
3. For $r>0$, we have no critical points 

This is a specific type of **bifurcation** known as **saddlenode bifurcation**.
