### Sattlenode Bifurcations

Suppose we have the differential equation $\dot{x}=r+x^2$ for some parameter $r$. Let's consider the three [[📕phase portraits]] that result from $r<0$, $r=0$, and $r>0$:
1. For $r<0$, we have two critical points, where one is an [[📘attractor]] and the other is a [[📘repeller]]
2. For $r=0$, we have one semi-stable critical point at $x=0$
3. For $r>0$, we have no critical points 

This is a specific type of **bifurcation** known as **saddlenode bifurcation**. In the general case, the **form factor** is given by $\dot{x}=r\pm x^2$.

We can show that all saddlenode bifurcations take the form $\dot{x}=r\pm x^2$. Take, for instance, the example posed in [[🗒️saddlenode bifurcation]]. By expading the taylor serios of $e^{-x}$, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=r-x-e^{-x} \\
&=r-x-\left[1-x+\frac{x^2}{2!}-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\dots\right] \\
&=(r-1)-\frac 1 2 x^2+\mathcal{O}(x^3).
\end{align*}
$$
Specifically, we need $2$ local fixed points to collide and disappear, meaning that $f(x)$ must be locally parabolic.

In the general case, let $\dot{x}=f(x,r)$. At the bifurcation point $x=x^*$, let $r=r_c$. Consider the Taylor series expansion of $f(x,r)$:
$$
\dot{x}=f(x^*,r_c)+(x-x^*)\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\vert_{(x^*,r_c)}+(r-r^*)\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\vert_{(x^*,r_c)}+\frac 1 2 (x-x^*)^2\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}\vert_{(x^*,r_c)} +\dots.
$$
Like before, we will ignore the cubic terms in $(x-x^*)$ and quadratic terms in $(r-r_c)$. We get 
$$
\dot{x}=a(r-r^*)+b(x-x^*)^2,
$$
which takes the form of the original equation.

### Transcritical Bifurcations 

The form factor of **transcritical bifurcations** is given by $\dot{x}=rx-x^2$, where $r$ is the parameter. The three [[📕phase portraits]] for $r<0$, $r=0$, and $r>0$ take the following form:
- For $r<0$, the phase portrait is a parabola with an [[📘repeller]] at $r$ and an [[📘attractor]] at $0$.
- For $r=0$, the phase portrait is a downward-opening parabola with a semi-stable [[📘equilibrium points|📘fixed point]] at $0$.
- For $r>0$, the phase portrait is a parabola with an [[📘attractor]] at $r$ and a [[📘repeller]] at $0$.

The [[📕flow diagrams|📕flow diagram]] the differential equation above consists of two lines with equations $x=0$ and $x=r$. The former is unstable (dashed) for positive $r$, and the latter is unstable for negative $r$. 

In general, the definition of a transcritical bifurcation is a [[📘equilibrium points|📘fixed point]] that exists for all values of the parameter. However, the [[📙stability]] of the point may change with $r$.

This type of bifurcations is useful for modeling **lasers**. From the textbook

Let us consider a simplified model of the essential physics. The dynamical variable is the number of photons $n(t)$ in the laser field. Its rate of change is given by 
$$
\dot{n} = \text{gain} - \text{loss} = GnN-kn.
$$
where $G$ is the gain coefficient and $k$ is a rate constant; the repricol $r=1/k$ represents the typical lifetime of a photon in the laser. 

Then, suppose that in the absence of laser action, the pump keeps the number of excited atoms fixed at $N_0$. Then the actual number of excited atoms will be reduced by the laser process. Spcificially, we assume 
$$
N(t)=N_0-\alpha n 
$$ 
where $alpha>0$ is the rate at which atoms drop back to their ground states. Solving, we get 
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{n}(t)&=Gn(N_0-\alpha n)-kn \\
&= (GN_0 - k)n - \alpha Gn^2.
\end{align*}
$$

In this case, $N_0$ is the parameter. There are three cases: $N_0<\frac k G$, $N_0=\frac k G$, and $N_0>\frac k G$. In this case, we only care about positive $n$. 
- In the first case, the fixed point at $n=0$ is [[📘attractors|📘stable]]. 
- In the second case, the fixed point at $n=0$ is semi-stable.
- In the third case, the fixed point at $n=0$ is [[📘repellers|📘unstable]]

### Pitchfork Bifurcation 

The form factor of a **pichfork bifurcation** is given by $\dot{x}=rx-x^3$. 
- For $r\leq 0$, the only fixed point is at $0$. 
- For $r>0$, there two more fixed points at $\pm\sqrt{r}$.

In other words, the fixed points appear in pairs.
