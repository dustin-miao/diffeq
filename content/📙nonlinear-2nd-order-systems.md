Because most nonlinear systems do not have a closed form solution, we will focus mainly on the qualitative behavior of systems.

Solving, we get that the vectors are vertical along the graph $x=-e^{-y}$ and $y=0$. Note that to find the direction (left/right or up/down), we need to analyze the differential equation itself. At this point, we can categorize the fixed point as a nonlivnear version of a [[ðŸ“™2d-linear-systems|saddle]].

We find that on the top-left, $\dot{x}<0$ and $\dot{y}<0$; on the top-right, we have $\dot{x}>0$ and $\dot{y}<0$; on the bottom-left, above the line $x=-e^{-y}, we have $\dot{x}<0$ and $\dot{y}>0$; and on the bottom right, we have $\dot{x}>0$ and $\dot{y}>0$.

### Fixed Points and Linearization

Wec an approximate a phase portrait near a fixed point by linearizing it and using techniques from solving [[ðŸ“™2d-linear-systems|linear systems]]. Suppose we have some system 
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{x}&=f(x,y)\\
\dot{y}&=g(x,y)
\end{align*}
$$

Suppose there is some fixed point at $(x^*, y^*)$, implying that $f(x^*,y^*)=g(x^*,y^*)=0$. Let $u=x-x^*$ and $v=y-y^*$. Then, we have 
$$
\begin{align*}
\dot{u}=\dot{x}&=f(x^*+u,y^*+v)\\
&= f(x^*,y^*)+u\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}+\mathcal{O}(u^2,v^2,uv)
\end{align*}
$$

In other words, we have 
$$
\dot{u}=u\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial f}{\partial y},
$$
so $\dot{u}$ is linear in $u$ and $v$. Repeating for $v$, we get 
$$
\dot{v}=u\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}+v\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}.
$$

In other words, we have 
$$
\dot{\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial g}{\partial y} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Near the point, the behavior of the system is categonized by this system of differential equations. This matrix is known as the **Jacobian**.
