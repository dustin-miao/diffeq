title: ðŸ“™Phase Portraits
---

A **phase portrait** for a differential equation plots $\dot{x}$ as a function of $x$. This can be used to identify [[ðŸ“˜equilibrium points]] by finding where the function is $0$, as well as whether these points are stable or unstable.  

> [!example] Phase Portraits
>
> Consider the differential equation $\dot{x}=\sin x$. The phase portrait is a simple sine wave, with equilibrium points located at $n\pi$ for integer $n$. For odd $n$, the point is an [[ðŸ“˜attractors|ðŸ“˜attractor]], and for even $n$, the point is a [[ðŸ“˜repellers|ðŸ“˜repeller]]. For example, the [[ðŸ“˜initial value problem]] given by $x(0)=\pi/4$ will tend towards the equilibrium at $x=\pi$.

> Now consider the differential equation $\dot{x}=x-\cos x$. Setting $x=\cos x$, we find there is only one zero at $x\approx 0.739$. Because this point is a [[ðŸ“˜repellers|ðŸ“˜repeller]], initial values near the x-intercept will still tend towards infinity.
